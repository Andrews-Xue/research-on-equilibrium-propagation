# research on equilibrium propagation
 The equilibrium propagation algorithm is a machine learning framework based on an energy model. The algorithm makes up for the shortcomings of the traditional backpropagation algorithm and the contrastive Hebbian learning algorithm in the inconsistent computation used in backward and forward propagation. This makes the gradient propagation algorithm more reasonable in terms of biological interpretability. On the basis of referring to many papers, this paper makes a comprehensive investigation of the research background and state-of-the-art equilibrium propagation algorithm and finds some problems with equilibrium propagation. The article introduces the energy-based machine learning model and the gradient algorithm in detail, and makes a cross-sectional comparison between the equilibrium propagation algorithm and similar other algorithms. And it also points out the differences between the algorithms, and demonstrates the advantages and disadvantages of the equilibrium propagation algorithm. Based on the research, a case implementation of the equilibrium propagation algorithm is presented, and the effect of different data sets, loss functions, energy functions and activation functions is tested in the experiments.
